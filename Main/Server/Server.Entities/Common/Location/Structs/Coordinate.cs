///     A positive <see cref="Y" /> means that the coordinate is to the north of the origin, while
///     a negative <see cref="Y" /> means that the coordinate is to the south of the origin.
///     A zero <see cref="Z" /> means that the coordinate is on the ground fllor,
///     while a positive <see cref="Z" /> means that the coordinate is above
///     the ground floor and a negative <see cref="Z" /> means that the coordinate

///     This is different from TFS / OTX, where the X and Y values are positive only, with
